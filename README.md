# Teaching Materials for Data Analysis II: Python Introduction

## Overview
This repository contains the teaching materials for the **Python Introduction** module in **Data Analysis II (DA2)**. The materials are designed to provide a hands-on, interactive learning experience. The primary tools are Jupyter Notebooks, which can be run in presentation mode to combine **slides-style teaching** with **interactive coding**.

---

## Files Included
- `hello-world.slides.html`: A slide-based interactive notebook covering fundamental Python concepts.
- `hello-universe.slides.html`: A continuation that builds on the basics, introducing advanced concepts.

Both files are compatible with Jupyter's **RISE extension** for interactive presentation mode.

## Features
1. **Interactive Code Blocks**:
   - Students can modify and execute code directly in the slides.
   - Immediate feedback and real-time interaction make it easier to grasp concepts.

2. **Presentation Mode**:
   - The Jupyter notebooks are pre-configured to run in **presentation mode** using RISE.
   - The slides retain all notebook interactivity while offering a polished teaching interface.

3. **Topics Covered**:
   - **`hello-world`**: Python syntax, control flows, and basic data types.
   - **`hello-universe`**: Covers basics of **numpy**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn** and **statsmodels**.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Jupyter and RISE**:
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
   - Install RISE to enable presentation mode:
     ```bash
     pip install rise
     ```

2. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook in your terminal:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Navigate to the respective notebook (`hello-world.slides.html` or `hello-universe.slides.html`).
   - Press the `Run Slide Show` button to start the interactive presentation.

## Usage Tips
- Encourage students to experiment with the code snippets during the presentation to deepen their understanding.
- Adapt the content dynamically by editing code cells directly in the slides to suit the flow of the session.
